# Ecommerce Customer Analysis

Here we have some synthetic data for an E-commerce company. This company sells clothing online, however, they also offer in-store style and clothing advise where customers can come in store and meet with a personal stylist, and then go home and order their cloths either on a mobile app or the company's website.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We do the analysis here to answer this question.
